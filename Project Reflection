### Regular Expression Usage in JavaScript

This repository contains a JavaScript function `validateSyntax()` that utilizes regular expressions to validate input syntax. The function checks whether the input string adheres to a specific pattern, particularly designed for validating pet information.

### Regular Expression Logic

The `validateSyntax()` function employs the following regular expression to validate the input:

```javascript
/^pet_\d+[a-zA-Z]+$/
```

Explanation:
- `^pet_`: Asserts that the input string starts with "pet_".
- `\d+`: Matches one or more digits, representing the pet's birth year.
- `[a-zA-Z]+`: Matches one or more letters (uppercase or lowercase), representing the pet's name.
- `$`: Asserts the end of the input string.

### Benefits of Regular Expression Literals

Regular expression literals provide a concise and expressive way to define search patterns within JavaScript code. They offer advantages such as:
- **Readability**: Regular expression literals are self-contained and readable, enhancing code comprehension.
- **Ease of Use**: With literal syntax, developers can write regular expressions directly within JavaScript code without the need for additional quotation marks or escaping characters.
- **Efficiency**: Using regular expression literals can improve code performance, as they are compiled once and reused across function calls.

### Attributes: `async` vs `defer`

In HTML script elements, the `async` and `defer` attributes control how scripts are loaded and executed. Here's a brief comparison:

- **`async` Attribute**: When set, the script is fetched asynchronously, allowing it to execute without pausing HTML parsing. However, there's no guarantee on the order of script execution, and scripts may execute before the document finishes parsing.

- **`defer` Attribute**: Similar to `async`, but scripts with the `defer` attribute are executed in order after the document has been parsed, but before the `DOMContentLoaded` event. This ensures that scripts are executed in the order they appear in the document.

### Conclusion

Regular expression literals offer a powerful tool for pattern matching and validation in JavaScript. By leveraging these patterns, developers can create robust validation logic, enhancing the reliability of their applications. Additionally, understanding HTML script attributes like `async` and `defer` can optimize script loading and execution for better performance.
